					subject to immediate disqualification.
				</p>
				<p>
					Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
					expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers.
				</p>

				<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

				<p>
					Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to
					gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
					orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
					race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views,
					sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
					stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording
					against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or
					other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome
					sexual attention.
				</p>

				<p>
					Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
					expected to comply immediately.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
					harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a
					member of the staff immediately.
				</p>

				<p>
					If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
					organizers may take any action they deem appropriate. This
					includes warning the offender, expulsion, or reporting their
					behaviour to local law enforcement.
				</p>

				<p>
					Participants may not submit prior projects, which will be
					subject to immediate disqualification.
